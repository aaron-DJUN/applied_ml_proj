To sustain their sanguinary requirements, the pair cruises New York nightclubs in search of victims (as illustrated in a stunning opening sequence to the accompaniment of ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" performed by seminal Goth band Bauhaus). When John awakens one morning to discover telltale signs of aging, it is revealed that his own sustained youth is not permanent, and his physical decrepitude begins to increase at an incredible rate. In a panic, John visits the clinic of scientist Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon), who has recently published a book on reversing the aging process, but she initially dismisses him as a crank, leaving him to sit in the lobby for several hours... during which his body ages several decades. After learning of his condition, Sarah traces John to his uptown flat. John is nowhere to be found, having been consigned by Miriam to a box in the attic with her legions of undead loves, leaving Miriam to deal with Sarah -- which she does quite effectively, seducing her into a steamy lesbian tryst. Their passion is consummated by a mingling of Miriam's blood with Sarah's, which later manifests itself as a psychic link between the two women and leaves Sarah with a rapidly-increasing appetite for blood. ~ Cavett Binion, Rovi",https://resizing.flixster.com/fXJIXeMUFr696_tB7jAYczzXDXI=/206x305/v1.bTs5NTgzNjIyO2o7MTg0MjU7MTIwMDszMDA7NDk0,"Catherine Deneuve,David Bowie,Susan Sarandon,Cliff De Young,Beth Ehlers,Dan Hedaya,Rufus Collins,Suzanne Bertish,James Aubrey,Bauhaus,Ann Magnuson,Shane Rimmer,Douglas Lambert,Bessie Love,John Pankow,Willem Dafoe,Sophie Ward,Philip Sayer,Lise Hilboldt,Michael Howe,Ed Wiley,Allan Richards","Apr 29, 1983","Oct 5, 2004",98,MGM,,"Stylish yet hollow, \u003Cem\u003EThe Hunger\u003C\u002Fem\u003E is a well-cast vampire thriller that mistakes erotic moments for a satisfying story.",rotten,52,31,upright,1787,66,12848,5,16,15,3,2,5.61,5.65,POSITIVE,3.62

The story is set in the American south, where the mysterious Count Alucard (Lon Chaney Jr.) has recently taken up residence.

But when Katherine begins to look and act strangely, her former suitor Frank Stanley (Robert Paige) suspects that something's amiss. Assisted by town doctor Brewster (Frank Craven) and psychologist Laszlo (J.
